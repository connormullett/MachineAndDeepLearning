My assortment of different implementations of
algorithms to better understand Machine Learning
and Deep Learning

perceptron.py - implementation of a single learnable
  perceptron with a learning algorithm to adjust weights
  for desired outputs.

  This algorithm is only applicable for linear scalable data
